The folder contains two subfolders called gtrent2016-heroku and gtrent2016-local.

"gtrent2016-heroku" contains all source code and database of the web application we are running on the Heroku cloud platform.

"gtrent2016-local" contains source code of the same application we constructed. However, it only contains some test data instead of the whole database. It could be run locally for testing.
